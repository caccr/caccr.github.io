## How clean is my water? 

Of the **86** chemicals tested for in your water system, **17** **chemicals were detected**, and **12** **average annual chemical findings exceeded their MCL, though this dos not necessarily constitute an MCL violation**. <br>

In the plot below, the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) is shown as a black horizontal dashed line. Each contaminant tested for in your water utility is represented by a vertical bar, and the height of the bar indicates the level of contaminantion of that sample. Any contaminant at or exceeding the black horizontal dashed line indicates contaminated water, and values under the black line indicate **safe** drinking water. <br><br> Hover over the bars to see more information for each contaminant.

## Actions taken to assess violations
<!-- ## r if(nrow(violations) > 0) paste('Actions taken to assess violations') -->

When a measured contaminant exceeds the MCL, a set of regulatory actions is taken to improve water quality. All regulatory actions taken during the period of this report are shown below:  

Table or text summarizing this.  



***  


## What does this report mean?  

"What does this report mean?" need to describe how this report applies to the user.  You could add various language that is in the SWS template: https://www.waterboards.ca.gov/drinking_water/certlic/drinkingwater/documents/ccr/3ccr_swsrpttemplate_for_2018_ccr_english_20190219.docx

Does the information mean that the water delivered to the customer is meeting drinking water standards or not?  

Is the water system treating for the detect above the MCL’s and this needs to be reflected in this report.

## More information

### *Disclaimer*

This Consumer Confidence Report was automatically generated, and hence, the data herein may be incomplete or inaccurate. The authors claim no liability or responsibility for data quality. This data represents the average result of all post-treatment samples from the period from 2019-01-01 to 2019-08-15. For questions about your local water quality, contact your water system. The contact information for your water system can be found [here](https://sdwis.waterboards.ca.gov/PDWW/index.jsp). Search using your water system number: **0110005**.  

### *Important Vocabulary*

**Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL)** refers to the highest level of a contaminant that is allowed in drinking water.  Primary MCLs are set as close to the PHGs (or MCLGs) as is economically and technologically feasible. Secondary MCLs are set to protect the odor, taste, and appearance of drinking water.  

**Maximum Contaminant Level Goal (MCLG)**: The level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health.  MCLGs are set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA).  

**Public Health Goal (PHG)**: The level of a contaminant in drinking water below which there is no known or expected risk to health.  PHGs are set by the California Environmental Protection Agency.  


### *Explanation of terms in this report*

If a contaminant has an exceedance of 999%, this indicates a detection for which the MCL is 0. Any number divided by 0 is infinite, thus it is assigned an arbitarty large value to indicate exceedance.

In the barplot and table above, `XMOD` indicate additional qualifiers on the data.  

* `<`: the measured amount did not constitute a chemical detection  
* `V`: valid data  
* `-`: the data can be negative (e.g. radionuclides and Langelier index)  
* `F`: false positive  
* `I`: invalidated  
* `Q`: questionable
